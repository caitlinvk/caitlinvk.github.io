  servings: 15 square bars
  prep: 15 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 1/3 cup old-fashioned Quaker oats
    * 1/4 cup flaxseed meal
    * 2 scoops protein powder (vanilla or chocolate works fine)
    * 1 tsp cinnamon
    * 3/4 tsp salt
    * 4 medjool dates + 2-3 tbsp warm water
    * 1/2 cup natural peanut butter (I use Trader Joes' Creamy Salted)
    * 3 tbsp maple syrup
    * 2 tbsp melted coconut oil
    * melted dark chocolate
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. In a food processor or blender, add oats, flaxseed meal, protein powder, cinnamon, and salt. Blend on medium speed until it becomes a fine texture.
    2. Mash the dates with 2-3 tbsp warm water until the dates are soft and form a smooth paste (just enough so that food processor/blender can break them down).
    3. In an 8x8 baking dish, evenly press mixture until flat. Melt chocolate in microwave and spread an even layer on top.
    4. Let set in freezer for 30 minutes, then cut into 12 equal square bars. Store in fridge.
