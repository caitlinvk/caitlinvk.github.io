	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Hi! I'm Caitlin Van Kirk and welcome to my food blog! I love healthy, wholesome recipes, so I created this website to share some of my favorites. I have been cooking for my family for as long as I can remember and I wanted to share my love for cooking with others.</p>

	<p>I am currently a Junior in high school in Dallas, Texas. I am taking Computer Science this year at school and I really enjoy it. I created this website using open-source code on github and modified it to make it my own. I am excited to use this background to share my favorite recipes! Please visit the contact page if you have any questions.</p>
