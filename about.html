	<p>Hi! I'm Caitlin Van Kirk and welcome to my food blog! I love healthy, wholesome recipes and wanted to create a platform to share.</p>

	<p>I am currently a Junior in high school in Dallas, Texas. I am taking Computer Science this year at school and I have found a passion for it. I created this website using open-source code on github and modified it to make it my own! Visit the contact page </p>
