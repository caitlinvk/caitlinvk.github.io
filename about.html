	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Hi! I'm Caitlin Van Kirk and welcome to my food blog! I love healthy, wholesome recipes, and I am so excited to share some of my favorites. I use real ingredients to make food that makes you feel good! I have been cooking for my family for as long as I can remember and I wanted to share my love for cooking with others.</p>

	<p>I am currently a Junior in high school in Dallas, Texas. I am taking Computer Science this year at school and I really enjoy it. I created this website using open-source code on github and modified it to make it my own. I wanted to connect my love for cooking with my love for computer science!</p>
	
	<p>Please visit the contact page if you have any questions. So happy you stopped by!<p>
